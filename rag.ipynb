In mathematics, the statement that 1 plus 1 equals 2 is a fundamental principle known as the \"principle of identity.\" This principle is based on the concept of addition, where combining one unit with another unit results in a total of two units. The basic arithmetic operation of addition involves combining two quantities to find their sum. When you add one unit to another unit, the result is always two units. Therefore, based on the principles of arithmetic and mathematical logic, it can be proven that 1 plus 1 equals 2.\n"

Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft\\n       network spans rideshare, bikes, and scooters and we are well positioned to deliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture\\n       significantly more of our market opportunity.                                \\n     • Deliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to a variety of\\n       economic opportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We also\\n       provide drivers with a suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources\\n       they need before taking the road.                                            \\n     • Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to\\n       drivers and riders and additional investments in our payments and data science capabilities have been central to making our network more efficient\\n       and seamless to use.                                                         \\n   Competition                                                                      \\n       The market for Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”) networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting\\n   levels of demand and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants\\n   in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these\\n   competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth\\n   stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n       Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network\\n   companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\\n   include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly\\n   in markets outside of the United States.                                         \\n       Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive\\n   manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS\\n   offerings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), which is offering autonomous ride-hailing services in certain markets, Amazon\\n   (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and\\n   suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\n       We believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name\\n   recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly\\n   greater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled\\n   “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely\\n   affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”             \\n   Seasonality                                                                      \\n       The revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays.\\n   Demand for our transportation network has historically declined over the winter season and demand for our network of Light Vehicles has historically\\n   increased during more temperate and dry seasons.                                 \\n   Our Brand and Marketing                                                          \\n       We believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our\\n   marketing efforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct\\n   communications like email and social media engagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider and driver communities.Our marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential\\n   drivers and riders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships,'), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content=\"they’ll earn before accepting a ride. We also launched the Weekly Pay Statement for a clearer, more comprehensive view of driver's pay details.\\n     • Insurance.

To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride\\n       booked through the Lyft App.                                                 \\n     • Support. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.\\n   Riders                                                                           \\n                                                                                    \\n       Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and\\n   from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated,\\n   riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft\\n   App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation\\n   network of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include: \\n     • Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently\\n       matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability.\\n       Additional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as\\n       Women+ Connect. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their\\n       trip.                                                                        \\n     • Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data\\n       to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time\\n       pickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to\\n       make up for it.                                                              \\n     • Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. Wait &\\n       Save, a substantial and growing portion of rides, offers riders a way to save money when they aren’t in a hurry.\\n     • Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative\\n       products, policies and processes. We have a dedicated safety response team, a partnership with ADT, Inc. (“ADT”) to aid in emergencies, and work\\n       with leading national organizations to inform our safety policies. We are always working to make Lyft as safe as we can.\\n   BusinessWe work with organizations across a wide range of industries to deliver transportation solutions.

As a result of our\\n   partnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content=\"revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing\\n   marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating\\n   revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware\\n   sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (“PBSC”).\\n       Riders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we\\n   launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches\\n   with nearby women and nonbinary riders. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders,\\n   creating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and\\n   shareholders.                                                                    \\n       Additionally, we aim to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.

We can’t talk about\\n   work that serves customer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of\\n   communities we serve. We’re working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”), riders take more\\n   sustainable transportation modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. We’ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our platform by investing in\\n   EV driver incentives, expanding the Express Drive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging and advocating for smart EV policy.\\n       We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand\\n   and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a\\n   transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.\\n   Our Transportation Network                                                       \\n   Our transportation network is primarily comprised of:                            \\n     • Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively\\n       incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer\\n       convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in\\n       cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare\\n       offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort and Black.\\n   1 Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we began presenting Gross Bookings and Rides as our key business metrics, which we believe best align with how\\n   management assesses our performance and measures achievement against our strategic priorities and opportunities. For the definition of Gross Bookings and\\n   Rides, refer to the “Definitions of Key Metrics” section within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.• Express Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets\\n       our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary,\\n       Flexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.\\n     • Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are\\n       more active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These transportation modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-\\n       mile of a multimodal trip with public transit.                               \\n   Drivers                                                                          \\n       The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities.

We’re making it easier to get out of the house, and the hundreds of millions of rides\\n   we facilitated in 2023 connected people with friends, family, and coworkers.

Drivers may be students putting themselves through college, parents looking for a\\n   way to earn while their kids are in school, or seniors interested in meeting new people. The flexibility to work on their own schedules is a core benefit of\\n   driving with Lyft, and millions of drivers use the platform to support their families or build toward their dreams. We keep working to understand who drivers\\n   are and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report.             \\n       We want to improve the lives of everyone we interact with, but know that targeted programs can have an outsized impact. Through our Lyft Up\\n   initiative, we’re working to provide riders access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go — no matter their age, income, zip, or postal\\n   code. In 2023, Lyft provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to people in need. We provided access to\\n   millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to help people in need. Some of our current Lyft Up programs assist the\\n   community by providing rides to and from jobs, job interviews and trainings, the grocery store for those living in food-insecure areas, and by providing\\n   discounted bikeshare memberships and heavily discounted electric bikes to income eligible riders. Other Lyft Up programs provide donated ride credits to\\n   resettlement agencies and other community based organizations helping refugees access essential needs and services or relief rides in the aftermath of natural\\n   or manmade disasters.                                                            \\n   Corporate Governance                                                             \\n       Our board of directors regularly evaluates our environmental, social, and corporate governance policies to make sure they fit into our strategy of\\n   driving long-term stockholder value and align with our core values.

If these experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies we introduce based on the results of such\\n   experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders\\n   and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected. \\n       Developing and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties,\\n   including risks related to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated\\n   delays or challenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of\\n   our ability to accurately forecast rider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and\\n   negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new\\n   initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new\\n   offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate sufficient\\n   returns on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or more\\n   offerings. For example, we shut down our roadside assistance offering, vehicle services offering, and parking offering, all of which were initially launched in\\n   2021. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders, our ability to increase\\n   utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\n   operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations may be\\n   impacted by our investments in the future.                                       \\n   If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of\\n   operations could be adversely affected.                                          \\n       Our expansion, either through our first party offerings or third-party offerings through our partnerships, into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of\\n   transportation and vehicle rental program has increased the complexity of our business.

For example, our Wait & Save offering, which enables riders to\\n   opt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride, involves inherent challenges\\n   in predicting the future locations of drivers. We also face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party\\n   public transit data into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time\\n   we reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal platform and have in the past decided and may again decide to discontinue or modify an offering or certain\\n   features.

Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing\\n   and our other offerings across a variety of use cases. We cannot be certain whether the behavioral and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue\\n   to negatively impact the willingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or rider demand for shared bikes or scooters, or otherwise limit market\\n   growth. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused our Shared Rides offerings, and we were temporarily restricted from operating our\\n   scooter share program in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures. We had to suspend or discontinue these offerings from time to time due to\\n   various concerns. In the event of significant public health concerns, such as COVID-19, or other events beyond our control, we may be required or believe it is\\n   advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a\\n   result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’\\n   platforms, health concerns, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not\\n   achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we re-evaluate themarkets in which we operate and the performance of our offerings, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as\\n   a result of such evaluations. For example, we now offer Shared Rides exclusively in connection with business-to-business partnerships and only in select\\n   markets. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n   If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our\\n   business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.         \\n       Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and\\n   procedures and to increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered sign-up and referral\\n   bonuses and provided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally\\n   able to switch between our platform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling\\n   opportunities to increase earnings and other incentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors\\n   and other companies in the app-based work industry or other industries, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements\\n   for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our\\n   platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For\\n   example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets and offered increased\\n   incentives to improve driver supply. Our revenue and results of operations have in prior periods been negatively impacted by supply incentives, and to the\\n   extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer increased incentives to improve supply, our revenue and results of operations may be negatively\\n   impacted in the future. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities described\\n   in the ballot measure. In addition, in connection with a settlement with the New York Attorney General, the Company will implement certain operational\\n   changes that may entail increased costs. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increase our expenses. Ongoing\\n   litigation seeking to reclassify drivers as employees is pending in multiple jurisdictions, including as described in the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note\\n   9, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If such litigation is successful in one\\n   or more jurisdictions, we may be required to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those jurisdictions, and we may incur\\n   significant expenses to resolve the matters at issue in the litigation. If this occurs, we may need to develop and implement an employment model that we have\\n   not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks relating to our ability to\\n   onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee drivers to\\n   meet rider demand.                                                               \\n       If drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and to\\n   increase their utilization of our platform could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers could fail to attract and retain qualified\\n   drivers or fail to increase utilization, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\\n   immigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result\\n   in increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations or research and\\n   development efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected. Other\\n   factors outside of our control, such as concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the\\n   availability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers on our platform or\\n   their utilization of our platform, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail to increase their\\n   utilization of our platform or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining a competitive')]\n",

We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a\\n   transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.\\n   Our Transportation Network                                                       \\n   Our transportation network is primarily comprised of:                            \\n     • Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively\\n       incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer\\n       convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in\\n       cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare\\n       offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort and Black.\\n   1 Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we began presenting Gross Bookings and Rides as our key business metrics, which we believe best align with how\\n   management assesses our performance and measures achievement against our strategic priorities and opportunities. For the definition of Gross Bookings and\\n   Rides, refer to the “Definitions of Key Metrics” section within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.• Express Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets\\n       our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary,\\n       Flexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.\\n     • Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are\\n       more active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These transportation modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-\\n       mile of a multimodal trip with public transit.                               \\n   Drivers                                                                          \\n       The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between.\\n   We work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity\\n   to focus their time on what matters most. Drivers on our platform also have key benefits, which include:\\n     • Flexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\\n     • Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to\\n       drive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis.                       \\n     • Transparent and Consistent Pay: We've released multiple products over the years such as upfront pay where drivers can see ride information and what\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content='mandate that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms, with additional requirements to reduce their GHG emissions on a\\n   GHG per passenger-mile basis.

The\\n   workplace environment has changed significantly in the last couple of years and we have changed our philosophy to reflect what we believe will produce the\\n   best results for our employees and business moving forward. Thus, in 2023, we welcomed employees back to the office and have implemented a hybrid model\\n   where employees have the flexibility to work from home. As of December 31, 2023, we had 2,945 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple\\n   locations in the U.S. and internationally in Montreal, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico, Kyiv, Ukraine, Berlin, Germany, Munich, Germany and Minsk, Belarus.\\n   None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we\\n   consider our relations with our employees to be positive.                        \\n       We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the\\n   more our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2023, our\\n   employee base was 57% male and 40% female, and women represented 42% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 46% White,\\n   32% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 7% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our\\n   employee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded\\n   from the applicable disclosure. As of December 31, 2023, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 3% of total employees, and\\n   employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 1% of total U.S. employees.\\n       We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates,\\n   develop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early candidate\\n   pipeline development as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization. In 2023, we continued our\\n   partnerships and outreach programs by holding partnership events with organizations that aim to increase diversity in enterprise hiring pools, such as\\n   BreakLine, Tribaja, and Disability:IN. We also maintained representation in our hiring pool through our sourcing tool, hireEZ, and held disability and inclusion\\n   training for team members with the Inclusively and Direct Employers organizations.\\n   Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”)                           \\n       We are proud of the impact we made on people and the planet in 2023, and we have reported in depth on what we have done in our 2023 ESG Report.\\n   As we grow, we’ll touch millions more lives — economically, socially, and environmentally.\\n   Environmental                                                                    \\n       We have a responsibility to our shared environment — the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. Our environmental impact also\\n   gives drivers and riders another great reason to choose Lyft, and is an intrinsic part of how we think aboutour business goals. We are working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to EVs, riders take more sustainable modes, and\\n   businesses reduce their carbon footprint.                                        \\n       The rides that we facilitate on our platform make up over 95% of Lyft’s carbon emissions. Transitioning these rides from gas-powered to electric\\n   vehicles is the one of the best ways we can contribute long-term toward a cleaner planet.\\n       Over 8 million riders rode in an EV in 2023. Rides in electric vehicles generally get higher ratings and tips compared to rides in hybrids and gas cars.\\n   Over 20% of rides on the Lyft Platform are currently in a hybrid or an EV. In April 2023, we launched Green, where riders can select an EV or hybrid vehicle,\\n   specifically for business travelers, and in January 2024, we expanded Green to nearly 40 airports in North America.\\n       Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft strives to grow EVs on the platform.

For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We also\\n       provide drivers with a suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources\\n       they need before taking the road.                                            \\n     • Invest in our Marketplace Technology.

We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants\\n   in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these\\n   competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth\\n   stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n       Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network\\n   companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\\n   include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly\\n   in markets outside of the United States.                                         \\n       Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive\\n   manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS\\n   offerings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), which is offering autonomous ride-hailing services in certain markets, Amazon\\n   (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and\\n   suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\n       We believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name\\n   recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly\\n   greater resources for the development of their offerings.

Unless otherwise stated,\\n   riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft\\n   App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation\\n   network of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include: \\n     • Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently\\n       matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability.\\n       Additional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as\\n       Women+ Connect. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their\\n       trip.                                                                        \\n     • Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data\\n       to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time\\n       pickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to\\n       make up for it.                                                              \\n     • Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. Wait &\\n       Save, a substantial and growing portion of rides, offers riders a way to save money when they aren’t in a hurry.\\n     • Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative\\n       products, policies and processes. We have a dedicated safety response team, a partnership with ADT, Inc. (“ADT”) to aid in emergencies, and work\\n       with leading national organizations to inform our safety policies.

Riders have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and\\n   bike and scooter sharing offerings. Rider preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our rider base, we must appeal to new riders who have\\n   historically used other forms of transportation or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have\\n   been and will continue to be critical in promoting awareness of our offerings, which in turn drives new rider growth and rider utilization. However, our\\n   reputation, brand and ability to build trust with existing and new riders may be adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings,\\n   our policies, including our pricing algorithms and pricing policies, the quality of our service, including timely pick-ups, drivers on our platform, or our\\n   competitors, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Further, if existing and new riders do not perceive the transportation services provided by\\n   drivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant offerings and features on our platform, we may not be able to\\n   attract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals\\n   from ourexisting riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remain satisfied with our offerings. In addition, we have experienced\\n   and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the winter months, which may harm our ability to attract and\\n   retain riders during such periods. We have experienced volatility in the health of our overall marketplace, and demand for our platform has not returned to pre-\\n   COVID-19 pandemic levels in all markets. We can not predict whether these impacts will continue, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our\\n   rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform by existing riders, we may not be able to provide drivers with an adequate\\n   level of ride requests, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient\\n   utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\n   affected.                                                                        \\n   We rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and\\n   reinsure our operations-related risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are\\n   unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial\\n   condition and results of operations.                                             \\n       From the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we,\\n   through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary and deductibles, often bear substantial financial risk with respect to auto-related incidents, including auto\\n   liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and\\n   general business liabilities up to certain limits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related\\n   risks, we procure a number of third-party insurance policies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance\\n   subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, of the auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our\\n   reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance\\n   providers are reimbursed for claims payments. If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory requirements or other regulations governing insurance\\n   coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If any of our third-party insurance providers or administrators\\n   who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they could be unable to pay any claims that we make.\\n       We also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’\\n   compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability and general business liabilities, including product\\n   liability. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to,\\n   acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and\\n   evolving offerings, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our\\n   insurance or reinsurance providers becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded\\n   from insurance coverage including, but not limited to losses caused by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.\\n       The amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate'), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content='and nonbinary passengers. If these experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies we introduce based on the results of such\\n   experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders\\n   and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected. \\n       Developing and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties,\\n   including risks related to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated\\n   delays or challenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of\\n   our ability to accurately forecast rider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and\\n   negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new\\n   initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new\\n   offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate sufficient\\n   returns on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or more\\n   offerings. For example, we shut down our roadside assistance offering, vehicle services offering, and parking offering, all of which were initially launched in\\n   2021. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders, our ability to increase\\n   utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\n   operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations may be\\n   impacted by our investments in the future.                                       \\n   If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of\\n   operations could be adversely affected.                                          \\n       Our expansion, either through our first party offerings or third-party offerings through our partnerships, into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of\\n   transportation and vehicle rental program has increased the complexity of our business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and\\n   marketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example, our Wait & Save offering, which enables riders to\\n   opt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride, involves inherent challenges\\n   in predicting the future locations of drivers. We also face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party\\n   public transit data into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time\\n   we reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal platform and have in the past decided and may again decide to discontinue or modify an offering or certain\\n   features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may not provide the benefits we expect in the long term. If we are unable to\\n   successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including the effects our new and evolving offerings have on our\\n   existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n   Our metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived\\n   inaccuracies in those metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\n       We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make\\n   strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from\\n   estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely,\\n   and we may make material adjustments to our processes for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, reflect newly available information, address\\n   errors in our methodologies, or other reasons, which may result in changes to our metrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and\\n   expected growth of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have\\n   forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Further, as our business develops, we may introduce, revise or cease reporting certain\\n   metrics if we change how we manage our business such that new metrics are appropriate, if we determine that revisions are required to accurately or\\n   appropriately measure our performance, or if one or more metrics no longer represents an effective way to evaluate our business. If investors or analysts do not\\n   consider our metrics to be accurate representations of our business or compare our metrics to third party estimates or similarly titled metrics of our competitors\\n   or others in our industrythat are not calculated on the same basis, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock and our\\n   business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n   Any failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial\\n   condition and results of operations.                                             \\n       Our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to\\n   provide high-quality support, including both in-person and remote support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\\n   relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leaving something in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident.

We are making investments in\\n   expanding our AI capabilities in our platform, offerings, services and features, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning\\n   and AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies, including, for example, generative AI. AI algorithms or automated processing\\n   of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain inaccurate or biased information, which can create discriminatory outcomes. AI algorithms\\n   may use third-party inputs with unclear intellectual property rights or interests. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of\\n   generative and other AI output, have not been fully interpreted by courts or fully addressed by federal or state regulations. The United States and other\\n   countries are considering comprehensive legal compliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European\\n   Commission has proposed the first such framework. In addition, there may be legislation or regulations from government bodies that similarly impose\\n   compliance obligations for AI. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact\\n   on our business. AI use or management by us or others, including decisions based on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or controversial data\\n   practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning, automated decision making, and algorithms, have and could impair the operationality or\\n   acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, such as negative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or\\n   our brand. These deficiencies could also undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and\\n   discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI may require us to allocate additional\\n   resources to help implement AI in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to make additional investments in the\\n   development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.\\n   If we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results\\n   of operations could be adversely affected.                                       \\n       Our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings\\n   will depend in part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve uponand enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce significant changes to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven\\n   offerings. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or authorizations or\\n   other regulatory constraints or because they fail to generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\n   could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new driver or rider demands regarding service or platform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings\\n   or a deterioration in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the\\n   attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our offerings or\\n   our business model. In addition, we frequently experiment with and test different offerings and marketing strategies. For example, in September 2023 we\\n   launched Women+ Connect, an offering with a goal of increasing women drivers on the platform by helping match women and nonbinary drivers with women'), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content='actions may adversely affect our business and financial results and may not have the desired benefits. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered,\\n   and may continue to offer, driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a driver retains, combined with the driver incentives a driver receives\\n   from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of gross bookings we generate for a given ride. Furthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers\\n   and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these\\n   locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local laws and\\n   regulations regarding pricing limitations during a government declared State of Emergency have imposed limits on prices for certain services, and state and\\n   local laws and regulations have imposed minimum earnings standards for drivers, which, at times, have caused us to increase prices in certain markets,\\n   including California, New York and Washington. We have tested or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives,\\n   such as our earnings commitment, subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. We have also modified, and expect to in the future modify,\\n   existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. To the extent any strategies, initiatives or modifications to our pricing methodologies lead\\n   to real or perceived harm to driver earnings, our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing actions may not\\n   ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in loss of market share, negative public perception and harm to our\\n   reputation.                                                                      \\n       While we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may\\n   ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that\\n   classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing and earnings methodologies to account for such a\\n   change to driver classification. Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and an agreement with the New York Attorney General have enabled us to\\n   provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in those states, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has required, and will continue to require,\\n   additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to these new models, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or\\n   launched, and may in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates, fees and payment structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be\\n   successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, successful litigation to overturn Proposition 22, litigation over Lyft’s compliance with\\n   Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers on our platform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to\\n   the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing\\n   marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future underpricing or overpricing of our\\n   offerings due to changes we make to the technology used in our pricing. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our\\n   pricing methodologies. As we continue to launch new and develop existing asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles\\n   in our Express Drive program, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect our\\n   pricing methodologies. In addition, wehave established environmental programs that may also affect our pricing. Any such changes to our pricing methodologies or our ability to efficiently price our\\n   offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n   If we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of Light Vehicles, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over time,\\n   and manage the related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n       While some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing\\n   markets will continue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related\\n   offerings will be successful in such markets. For example, although we have exclusive rights to operate bike or scooter sharing programs in certain\\n   jurisdictions, we have faced competition in contravention of such rights and have incurred costs to defend against such challenges. A negative determination in\\n   other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, could adversely affect our\\n   competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from operating\\n   due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. While we do not expect any denial or\\n   suspension in an individual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of\\n   operations. Even if we are able to successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this\\n   nascent service offering. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the\\n   potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an increased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and\\n   scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform or incidents involving our competitors’ offerings.\\n       We design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective\\n   supply of bikes and scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be\\n   no assurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable')]\n",

We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants\\n   in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these\\n   competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth\\n   stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n       Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network\\n   companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\\n   include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly\\n   in markets outside of the United States.                                         \\n       Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive\\n   manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada.

Unless otherwise stated,\\n   riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft\\n   App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation\\n   network of choice.

The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their\\n       trip.                                                                        \\n     • Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data\\n       to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time\\n       pickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to\\n       make up for it.                                                              \\n     • Affordability.

Wait &\\n       Save, a substantial and growing portion of rides, offers riders a way to save money when they aren’t in a hurry.\\n     • Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative\\n       products, policies and processes.

We still believe in the long-term transition to EVs, but now do not see a path to completing our'), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content='select ads to be served;                                                     \\n     • regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including\\n       regulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;                   \\n     • product changes or advertising inventory management decisions we may make that change the type, size or frequency of advertisements displayed on\\n       Lyft Media;                                                                  \\n     • adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our business or advertisers on our platform that may impact our brand and reputation\\n       and the willingness of advertisers to advertise on our platform;             \\n     • any liability, brand or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our platform;\\n     • advertisers may not agree to reformat or change their advertisements to comply with our guidelines;\\n                                                                                    \\n     • any driver, rider or third-party dissatisfaction due to advertisements; and  \\n     • our ability to increase or maintain driver adoption and use of Lyft Media products.\\n       These and other factors could harm our Lyft Media business and the ability of our Lyft Media business to achieve the return on investment we expect\\n   which could harm our business.                                                   \\n   Use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets\\n   used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.                       \\n       We use artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning and automated decision making) for our internal work streams and productivity as\\n   well as in our platform, offerings, services and features, which may present additional risks, including risks inherent in its use. We are making investments in\\n   expanding our AI capabilities in our platform, offerings, services and features, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning\\n   and AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies, including, for example, generative AI. AI algorithms or automated processing\\n   of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain inaccurate or biased information, which can create discriminatory outcomes. AI algorithms\\n   may use third-party inputs with unclear intellectual property rights or interests. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of\\n   generative and other AI output, have not been fully interpreted by courts or fully addressed by federal or state regulations. The United States and other\\n   countries are considering comprehensive legal compliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European\\n   Commission has proposed the first such framework. In addition, there may be legislation or regulations from government bodies that similarly impose\\n   compliance obligations for AI. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact\\n   on our business. AI use or management by us or others, including decisions based on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or controversial data\\n   practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning, automated decision making, and algorithms, have and could impair the operationality or\\n   acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, such as negative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or\\n   our brand. These deficiencies could also undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and\\n   discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI may require us to allocate additional\\n   resources to help implement AI in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to make additional investments in the\\n   development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.\\n   If we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results\\n   of operations could be adversely affected.                                       \\n       Our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings\\n   will depend in part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve uponand enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce significant changes to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven\\n   offerings. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or authorizations or\\n   other regulatory constraints or because they fail to generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operations\\n   could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new driver or rider demands regarding service or platform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings\\n   or a deterioration in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the\\n   attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our business and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our offerings or\\n   our business model. In addition, we frequently experiment with and test different offerings and marketing strategies. For example, in September 2023 we\\n   launched Women+ Connect, an offering with a goal of increasing women drivers on the platform by helping match women and nonbinary drivers with women'), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content='and nonbinary passengers. If these experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and strategies we introduce based on the results of such\\n   experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders\\n   and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected. \\n       Developing and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties,\\n   including risks related to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated\\n   delays or challenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of\\n   our ability to accurately forecast rider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and\\n   negative publicity in the event such new or enhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new\\n   initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new\\n   offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate sufficient\\n   returns on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or more\\n   offerings. For example, we shut down our roadside assistance offering, vehicle services offering, and parking offering, all of which were initially launched in\\n   2021. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders, our ability to increase\\n   utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\n   operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations may be\\n   impacted by our investments in the future.                                       \\n   If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of\\n   operations could be adversely affected.                                          \\n       Our expansion, either through our first party offerings or third-party offerings through our partnerships, into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of\\n   transportation and vehicle rental program has increased the complexity of our business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and\\n   marketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example, our Wait & Save offering, which enables riders to\\n   opt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride, involves inherent challenges\\n   in predicting the future locations of drivers. We also face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party\\n   public transit data into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time\\n   we reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal platform and have in the past decided and may again decide to discontinue or modify an offering or certain\\n   features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may not provide the benefits we expect in the long term. If we are unable to\\n   successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including the effects our new and evolving offerings have on our\\n   existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n   Our metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived\\n   inaccuracies in those metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\n       We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make\\n   strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from\\n   estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely,\\n   and we may make material adjustments to our processes for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, reflect newly available information, address\\n   errors in our methodologies, or other reasons, which may result in changes to our metrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and\\n   expected growth of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have\\n   forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Further, as our business develops, we may introduce, revise or cease reporting certain\\n   metrics if we change how we manage our business such that new metrics are appropriate, if we determine that revisions are required to accurately or\\n   appropriately measure our performance, or if one or more metrics no longer represents an effective way to evaluate our business. If investors or analysts do not\\n   consider our metrics to be accurate representations of our business or compare our metrics to third party estimates or similarly titled metrics of our competitors\\n   or others in our industrythat are not calculated on the same basis, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock and our\\n   business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n   Any failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial\\n   condition and results of operations.                                             \\n       Our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to\\n   provide high-quality support, including both in-person and remote support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\\n   relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leaving something in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide\\n   effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain service providers who are qualified to support users and sufficiently')]\n",
