(the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-\\n   demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and\\n   Canada. We have an important purpose, which is to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to provide drivers a way to work that\\n   gives them control over their time and money.                                    \\n       Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in\\n   select cities in Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers'), Document(metadata={'source': 'local'}, page_content='rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of\\n   rides to improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings.

We collect service fees and\\n   commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings1 and Rides1 increase, driving more\\n   revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing\\n   marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating\\n   revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware\\n   sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (“PBSC”).\\n       Riders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we\\n   launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches\\n   with nearby women and nonbinary riders.
